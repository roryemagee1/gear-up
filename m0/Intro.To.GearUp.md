## Gear Up Pre-Work

_Our **mission** is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers._

### What is the purpose of Gear Up in Mod 0?

* Reflect on intersectionality and how your identity impacts your experiences and interactions with others

Intersectionality posits that there the a hierarchy to all systems of oppression and that the experiences of the oppressed intersect with each other along the lines of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, ability, religion, etc.  Being a white male has inadvertently put me toward the top of the hierarchy in society.  Even though I do not intend to oppress, my position in the hierarchy is a place of privilege and so the onus is on me to listen to the experiences of people outside of my position and to acknowledge my privilege and use it as a way of bringing stronger egalitarianism to society.  

In the world of software development, I have an advantage because the majority of my colleagues come from the same place in the hierarchy as me.  I must do all that I can to dismantle the biases and injustices that come along with this hierarchical advantage by creating a more inclusive software development community whenever possible.  While I should do this because it is the right thing to do, I also acknowledge that diversity brings a ton of benefit for our lives and communities an allows us to come up with new and innovative ideas in the software development space as well.  In addition to doing the right thing by being inclusive, I am also interested in helping us all to realize our potential as individuals, as groups, and as a society as a whole.

* Develop greater empathy and awareness of the experiences of others in the field of software development

### Pre-Work Preparation
#### Background Knowledge

Step 1: Watch this video from Google. 
* ["Unconconscious Bias at Work"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW5s_-Nl3JE)

Step 2: If you are unfamiliar with the term "Implicit Bias," take time to read this article to build your background knowledge. 
* ["PBS News Hour: Implicit Bias"](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/making-people-aware-of-their-implicit-biases-doesnt-usually-change-minds-but-heres-what-does-work)

#### Reflect
Create a gist on Github and reflect (4-6 sentences) on the following questions:

* What were your reflections from the video?

Implicit and unconscious biases are real.  I've noticed myself making subconscious decisions before confirming them to exist.  In acknowledging this, I am taking the first step towards correcting for implicit biases.  This is not a one time lesson, but rather a process of continuous development that I must integrate into my daily life as I work on creating a more just and equitable society.

* In what ways have you examined your implicit biases before coming to Turing?

Way back when, I took an implicit bias test.  Although the test showed I have the lowest level of bias beyong having no bias, that is no reason to not work on correcting my biases.  Whenever intersectionality is applicable, I do my best to make myself consciously aware of how I am privileged in this life, how I've contributed to maintaining that privilege in the past, and how I can modify my thoughts and behaviors so that they contribute to dismantling hierarchies of oppression rather than maintaining them.

* What kind of software do you imagine building in the future? How will understanding biases (or avoiding understanding biases) impact your products?

In today's fast-paced software developer environment, we simply cannot afford to all conform to outdated and culturally homogenous ideas.  Instead, we must leverage our diversity so that we can create the most innovative software possible all while realizing our own individual and collective potential.

#### READ

If you are unfamiliar with the term "Intersectionality," take time to read this article to understand the theory and introduction of the concept. If you are familiar, move to the reflection questions.  
* ["What's Intersectionality? Let These Scholars Explain the Theory and Its History"](https://time.com/5560575/intersectionality-theory/)

#### Reflect
On your same gist, reflect on the following quesitons:

<b>“All of us live complex lives that require a great deal of juggling for survival,” Carty and Mohanty said in an email. “What that means is that we are actually living at the intersections of overlapping systems of privilege and oppression.”</b>

 * When you consider the way you move through the world, what elements of your identity are you most aware of on a daily basis?

I am most aware of the elements of my identity that give my a lot of privilege.  My whiteness and my maleness have allowed me to be treated with more respect and given more opportunities than those without those elements.  I am also aware of elements of my identity that once disadvantaged my ancestors, while now conferring benefits to me, i.e. my family's Irish heritage.

 * What strengths does your identity give you?  How will you utilize those at Turing?

My greatest strength comes from having family members that grew up in Ireland during the Irish war for independence, the Irish civil war, and the Troubles.  Having family members share those life experiences of hardship and tribulation has made me more empathetic and compassionate towards those who have been disadvanted by our society.  That empathy will allow me to listen intently to other students' experiences and will allow me to help them as best I can as an ally.

 * How do you think you could value the identies of those around you to bring out their strengths at Turing? Has there been a time where you were able to advocate or include people around you?

I want to be as open and receptive to the identities of the people around me as possible.  I want to learn what their lives have been like and how they differ from mine.  I want to approach them with sincere curiousity and welcomeness so that they feel comfortable working together at Turing.  I haven't had many opportunities to directly advocate for people in my life.  However, I have spent a great deal of time volunteering for the Democratic party and have done things like participating on the Outreach, Equity, and Inclusion committee in house district 8.  That experience has allowed me to indirectly build inclusity in the party and has allowed me to advocate for such inclusivity in our Denver civic community.

 * How will your strengths impact you as a teammate?  What will you bring to your cohort? 

My greatest strength is my ability to listen.  I will do all that I can to listen closely and sincerely.  I am a firm believer that if you listen closes enough, people will tell you exactly what they need and how you can help them, even if they don't do it directly.  My ability to listen will allow me to find out how I can best serve others, and that in turn, will let me serve others in Turing as best as I can.
